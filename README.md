C) Description - 
This website is my personal web portfolio that will be available to employers to showcase my skills, projects, and interests in a fun way. I hope to make it visually appealing and clean, and also include interactive elements such as the hover feature in my Projects page that will reveal hidden descriptions of the projects I've worked on.

D) How to Interact with My Website -
This site should be easily navigable, and many of the interactions will be small animations that add to the experience. If you hover
over any links (in the footer, header, or main body) they should react in some way to indicate the user is hovering over something.

E) External Libraries - 
I used Bootstrap in order to include some additional animation features and also to use the 12-column grid layout. I had originally wanted to use the cards feature but now have a card-like animation and other animations like popover. This adds formatting enhancements to my layout and greater responsiveness. 


F) Changes From HW7 - 
I included more "call to action" by adding a View My Projects button on the Home page that would take the user to my Projects page and by including a link to a PDF version of my resume in the About page in case an employer would want to have access to that.

G) Major Challenges -
What challenges did you experience in implementing your website? (2-4 sentences max)
A major challenge was implementing the Projects page animation and the positioning of elements around it. I ended up just doing a workaround that didn't include as much text in the overlay because I couldn't figure out how to implement it and it looks okay this way. A lot of the spacing errors I was also able to work around by simply using padding and then the Bootstrap library's grid layout

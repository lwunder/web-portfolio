C) Description - 
This website is my personal web portfolio that will be available to employers to showcase my skills, projects, and interests in a fun way. I hope to make it visually appealing and clean, and also include interactive elements such as the hover feature in my Projects page that will reveal hidden descriptions of the projects I've worked on.

D) How to Interact with My Website -
Use a bulleted list to describe how a user would interact with your website. For each item in your list, say
i. the interaction type you implemented
ii. how I should reproduce it (i.e. click on X on page Y, or scroll on page X,
etc.)

E) External Libraries - 
Describe what external tool(s) you used (JavaScript library, Web API, animations, or other). Following the bulleted list format below, reply to
each of the prompts.
i. Name of tool
ii. Why you chose to use it? (2-4 sentences max)
iii. How you used it? (2-4 sentences max)
iv. What it adds to your website? (2-4 sentences max)


F) Changes From HW7 - 
I included more "call to action" by adding a View My Projects button on the Home page that would take the user to my Projects page and by including a link to a PDF version of my resume in the About page in case an employer would want to have access to that.

G) Major Challenges -
What challenges did you experience in implementing your website? (2-4 sentences max)
